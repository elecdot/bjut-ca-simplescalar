# Build The Simplescalar

## Build From Source (Not Recommended)

>[!warning] To compile the source code, you need `<=gcc-3.4`

If you want to build Simplescalar from source, you may need:
- This [fork of source](https://github.com/Awesome-BUPT/simple-scalar) (Since the official source page is shut down)
- This [build guide](http://www.ann.ece.ufl.edu/courses/eel5764_10fal/project/simplescalar_installation.pdf)

## Use Docker Images

Use this [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/khaledhassan/simplescalar/latest/images/sha256-b54e4d6d6348beed0b91c41c89eaf46fee128e8b7172404a724a8a7abd021835) directly.
